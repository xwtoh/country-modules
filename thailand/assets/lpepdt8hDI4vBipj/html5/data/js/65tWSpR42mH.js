This has implications on how one sits, walks, or interact with another. Thus, it is not uncommon for a Thai to probe into your background and status so as to ensure that the appropriate norms are practised and also minimise any disrespect. The elderly or seniors within a family are highly respected and the younger generation are expected to defer to the advice/ requests of their elders.

Or it might materialise in a more nuanced manner, evident in the day-to-day way of life, such as cheerful banter, a clever joke, or some good-natured teasing where “fun is interspersed throughout the day” (Weiner, 2015). Sanuk can also be a kind of coping mechanism, where a smile provides an emotional buffer against the difficulties one face in life. It has its roots in Buddhism where life is transitory and to live life in the moment.\\n\\nMai pen rai - There is nothing to be done about it; it is what it is; it can’t be helped, nevermind, it doesn’t matter\\n\\nThe term “Mai pen rai” which translates to “never mind/it can’t be helped”, “there is nothing to be done about it” or “it is what it is”, reinforces this philosophy of “this too shall pass” and not to be too burdened when things do not turn out as planned. What could be deemed as a life and death matter probably isn’t so in the end. This may also have its basis from Buddhism’s philosophy of detachment which is to separate one’s thoughts and opinions from oneself, so as not to be too emotionally or mentally affected.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":371}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":712,"height":1136,"strokewidth":0}}},{"kind":"state","name":"Monarchy","data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":712,"bottom":764,"altText":"The Monarchy\\n\\nAs a country that has never been colonised throughout its history, Thailand is also known as “the Land of the Free”. This has become a source of national pride and forms an important part of Thai’s national identity. With its long history of monarchical rule, the King plays a central role in the lives of the Thai people. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who ruled from 1946 - 2016 (making him one of the world’s longest reigning monarch) was highly revered amongst his people. Criticisms or acts of disrespect the King or the royal family is considered a social taboo and illegal. Thailand has one of the strictest lèse-majesté (French term meaning “to do wrong to majesty”) law in the world, with penalties ranging from three the fifteen years for each count of criminal charge.  \\n","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":372}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":712,"height":764,"strokewidth":0}}},{"kind":"state","name":"Family","data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":712,"bottom":764,"altText":"The Family\\n\\nFamily and kinship are of utmost importance in Thai society and are considered the foundation of social life for most Thais. Most Thais use the word “phi” (for an older person) or “nong” (for a younger person) before someone’s nickname to denote affection and closeness. For couples who are married, it is not uncommon for them to be living in multi-generations households with the parents of the husband or wife, as well as other extended family members (such as unmarried siblings, or widowed distant relatives). Living in close proximity with their extended family means that it is not uncommon for children to be taken care of by their grandparents or aunts/uncles while their parents are away at work. The younger members of the family will also chip in financially or help to look after the elderly in the family. \\n\\nFamilial connections play an important role in Thailand. A person’s career path is often determined by his/her parents’ social and business connections. Although the higher educational levels and aspirations of the younger generation have created a shift in this trend, family connections remain an integral part of an individual’s career-related decision-making process.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":373}},"html5data":{"xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":712,"height":764,"strokewidth":0}}}],"animations":[{"kind":"animation","id":"Entrance","duration":1000,"hidetextatstart":true,"animateshapewithtext":false,"tweens":[{"kind":"tween","time":0,"duration":1000,"alpha":{"path":[{"kind":"segment","start":"0","dstart":"0","end":"100","dend":"0"}],"duration":1000,"easing":"linear","easingdir":"easein"}}]}],"width":712,"height":764,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6hDri0V57eO","variables":[{"kind":"variable","name":"_state","type":"string","value":"_default","resume":true},{"kind":"variable","name":"_disabled","type":"boolean","value":false,"resume":true},{"kind":"variable","name":"_stateName","type":"string","value":"","resume":true},{"kind":"variable","name":"_tempStateName","type":"string","value":"","resume":false}],"actionGroups":{"ActGrpClearStateVars":{"kind":"actiongroup","actions":[]}},"events":[{"kind":"ontransitionin","actions":[{"kind":"exe_actiongroup","id":"_player._setstates","scopeRef":{"type":"string","value":"_this"}}]}]}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":0,"yPos":346,"tabIndex":7,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":360,"rotateYPos":97,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":3,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"html5data":{"url":"","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":720,"height":194,"strokewidth":0}},"width":720,"height":194,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"background":{"type":"vector","vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":720,"bottom":194,"altText":"Scroll
